# Markov Image Generator
Makes a frequency table of the neighbors to each pixel then reconstructs the image using that table.  
It uses the concept of Markov chains (or that was the inspiration, at least).  It currently only runs on windows.  
This was done for the SB Hackathon in <36 hours.  It was more of a fun conceptual project rather than a tool. 

Example of an image put through 4 iterations:
